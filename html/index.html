                    <h3> - Rosalynn Carter </h3>

                    <p> As a leader, it is not your job to be liked. It is your job to be respected, and to work for the better of the group. I've seen firsthand the effect a truly great leader can have on a team, and I strive to be the cause for that effect in everything I do. </p>

                    <h1> "Leadership and Learning are indispensable to each other."</h1>

                    <h3> - John F. Kennedy </h3>

                    <p> If there was one quality that could be most directly correlated to great leaders, it would have to be the ability and the drive to learn. That single feature can set apart a leader who is respected and one who is rejected, and because of that, I highly value the process of learning and improvement. </p>
